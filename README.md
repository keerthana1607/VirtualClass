# VirtualClass
# Virtual CLassRoom
- It has instance variables `classrooms` and `students` to store classroom and student information, respectively.
- The constructor initializes these variables as empty maps.
- The class provides various methods for managing virtual classrooms and students:
- `addClassroom(String className)`: Adds a virtual classroom with the given name to the `classrooms` map.
- `addStudent(String studentID, String studentName, String className)`: Adds a student with the given ID and name to a specified classroom. It checks if the classroom exists before adding the student.
- `removeClassroom(String className)`: Removes a virtual classroom with the given name from the `classrooms` map.
- `removeStudent(String studentID)`: Removes a student with the given ID from both the `students` map and the associated classroom.
- `scheduleAssignment(String className, String assignmentDetails)`: Schedules an assignment with the specified details for a classroom.
- `submitAssignment(String studentID, String className, String assignmentDetails)`: Simulates a student submitting an assignment for a specific classroom.
- `listClassrooms()`: Lists all the virtual classrooms.
- `listStudents(String className)`: Lists all the students in a specified classroom.
- `listAssignments(String className)`: Lists all the assignments scheduled for a specified classroom.
- `delay(int seconds)`: A helper method to introduce a delay in seconds.
-The code also includes a `main` method that provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the `VirtualClassroomManager`. Users can add classrooms, students, schedule assignments, and perform other actions using this interface.
- A menu of options is displayed to the user, and the program responds based on the user's choice.
- The program continues to run until the user chooses to exit.
  # ClassRoom
- The `Classroom` class has three private instance variables: `name`, `students`, and `assignments`.
- The constructor of the class takes a `name` parameter and initializes the `name` variable with the provided value. It also initializes the `students` and `assignments` lists as empty ArrayLists.
- The class provides getter methods for accessing the `name`, `students`, and `assignments` properties.
- It has methods for adding and removing students from the classroom. The `addStudent` method adds a `Student` object to the `students` list, and the `removeStudent` method removes a `Student` object from the `students` list.
- The `scheduleAssignment` method allows scheduling assignments for the classroom. It adds an `Assignment` object to the `assignments` list.
  # Assignment
- The `Assignment` class has one private instance variable, `details`, which stores the details of the assignment.
- The constructor of the class takes a `details` parameter and initializes the `details` variable with the provided value.
- The class provides a getter method `getDetails()` to retrieve the details of the assignment.
  # Student
- The `Student` class has three private instance variables: `ID`, `name`, and `classroom`.
- The constructor of the class takes three parameters: `ID`, `name`, and `classroom`. It initializes the `ID`, `name`, and `classroom` instance variables with the provided values.
- The class provides getter methods for accessing the `ID`, `name`, and `classroom` properties.
